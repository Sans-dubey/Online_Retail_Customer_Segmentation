In this project, we analyzed a transactional dataset spanning from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail company specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. The objective was to segment the diverse customer base based on purchasing behaviors for tailored strategies. After exploring the dataset and addressing missing values, duplicates, and outliers, we applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling to capture customer engagement.

Using K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering, we categorized customers by their RFM scores, unveiling distinct segments with varying purchasing patterns. Insights revealed peak transaction periods, popular product categories per segment, and identified wholesalers. This segmentation enables targeted marketing, inventory optimization, and improved customer experiences.

In conclusion, this project addressed the challenge of customer segmentation for an online retail company. Through rigorous data exploration, feature engineering, preprocessing, and the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques, we successfully delineated distinct customer segments. By understanding the unique behaviors and preferences of these segments, the company can now implement targeted strategies to foster customer engagement, loyalty, and business growth.
